Deko Boko is a simple but highly extensible contact form, integrating reCAPTCHA for handling spam.

== Description ==

**I am currently no longer developing or supporting this plugin. I may resume development and support in the future, but I'm not sure when.**

**Installation of [Toppa Plugin Libraries for WordPress](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/toppa-plugin-libraries-for-wordpress/) is required. Please download and activate it before installing Deko Boko.**

**Why another contact form plugin?**

Why write yet another email contact form for WordPress? There are two things that make Deko Boko unique:

1. It uses [reCAPTCHA](http://www.google.com/recaptcha) for handling spam. reCAPTCHA is a great project that uses data from its captcha forms to help digitize books.

2. The Deko Boko contact form can be extended any way you want, but without the need for complicated admin menus. If you're comfortable editing HTML, then you can add any number and any type of input fields to the contact form. You can control which fields are optional or required. When the form is submitted, any fields that you added will have their data included in the body of the email.

**Features**

* The form layout is controlled by a CSS styled list, which provides a great deal of flexibility. With CSS edits you can change the position of the field labels to top-aligned, left-justified, or right-justified. Deko Boko uses the techniques outlined in [Cameron Adam's excellent article on form layout](http://www.sitepoint.com/fancy-form-design-css/).

* Plays nicely with [WP-reCAPTCHA](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-recaptcha/), the WordPress plugin for using reCAPTCHA to protect against comment spam. If you already have a API key set up with WP-reCAPTCHA, Deko Boko will automatically copy it to the Deko Boko settings.

* Includes selectors for using different themes and languages with the reCAPTCHA widget, as well as support for custom CSS for the reCAPTCHA widget.

* Support for multiple, custom contact forms.

* "CC Me" option for users to receive a copy of the message they submit to you. You can specify header text and footer text to "wrap" this message. Deko Boko can automatically include the name of your blog and a timestamp in the header or footer text.

* Security in addition to reCAPTCHA is included. Deko Boko protects against email header injections and XSS attacks.

* You can have Deko Boko load its stylesheet only on pages where you use the Deko Boko contact form, so it won't be loaded unnecessarily on other pages.

* Localization support: a dekoboko.pot file is included to enable translations to other languages.

* A sample form is included, to help you make your own custom contact form.

* You can put a custom copy of dekoboko.css in your active theme folder, so you won't lose your stylesheet customizations when upgrading Deko Boko.

== Installation ==

1. Install [Toppa Plugin Libraries for WordPress](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/toppa-plugin-libraries-for-wordpress/) in your plugin folder
1. Install Deko Boko in your plugin folder and activate.

The rewrite was prompted by IE7′s incompatibility with the widely used “clearfix” code in the previous versions of Deko Boko.
